Reflection:

    How do I approach designing software?
I complete the requirements given to me one by one, and make sure that I always have a working product after completing each one.

        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I need to really simplify the shapes of the objects, which I'm not used to doing in my art. Yes, breaking objects up into basic shapes is important while drawing themm, but usually, I'm the type to add a lot of details on afterwards. I had to be more minimalistic here. 

        What design process did you follow for your project work?
I created a scene in real life, took a photo of it, and broke the objects up into basic shapes. Later, I chose the objects I deemed most important to the scene to use in my scene, and built them out in the program.

        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This is a pretty logical design flow. Breaking thinsg up into chunks is always good, and that's what I try to do in my schoolwork, generally speaking. At SNHU this is usually fairly easy, because the rubrics do it for you.
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
I like the Agile approach. where you're meant to always have a working product.

        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Everything related to 3d was new. It's also a different experience working with existing code than making my own from scratch- I had to do more detective work than I am accustomed to doing for school, which is a good thing- detective work is most of what you do in a junior developer job.

        How did iteration factor into your development?
Unfortunately, a lot of my process was tweaking one small thing in my code and running it again, over and over and over. This wasn't the type of thing where I could code all of it, press run, and count on it to work.

        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It hasn't developed as well as it should, but I will say that modeling the objects got so much easier once the camera work was done. When I could move the camera, I could see what was wrong with my objects much more easily, and lay them out in maybe a quarter of the time. Towards the end, I broke up my code into smaller functions, which made it a lot cleaner.

    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I am a Project Manager right now, but I would not mind getting back into development eventually. Even without actually coding, background knowledge helps me do my job currently.

        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This gives me flexibility to use 3d graphics in my future projects, like my Capstone if I wanted to. This would also be helpful if I ever chose to take a game design course. 

        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Having this introduction makes it so I ahve more familiarity with 3d graphics, which may be useful in a future job down the line.
